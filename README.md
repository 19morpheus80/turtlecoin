### How To Compile

#### Ubuntu 16.04+ and MacOS 10.10+

There is a bash installation script for Ubuntu 16.04+ and MacOS 10.10+ which can be used to checkout and build the project from source:

`$ curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/master/multi_installer.sh" | bash `

On Ubuntu you will be asked for sudo rights to install software. The binaries will be in `./src` after compilation is complete.

This script can be used from inside the git repository to build the project from the checked out source, `./multi_installer.sh`

See the script for more installation details and please consider extending it for your operating system and distribution!

#### Windows 10
